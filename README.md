# CSharpWinFormsTemplate

Hello guys! this repository contains a C# WinForms template that can be used to create desktop applications Platformwide!

# WinForms
WinForms is short for Windows Forms, WinForms is an open source Graphical User Interface (aka GUI) class library that is powered by ".NET".
It is used to create desktop apps and also heavily used by an IDE called Visual Studio. WinForms is a great way to create your desktop applications in C#!
# Pro's and Con's
# Pro's
This C# WinForm template can be used in any C#-supported code editor as long as it uses ".NET Core" to compile the code.
It is very easy to add items (such as Buttons, Labels, Textboxes, etc.) to your WinForm apps.
You can copy files like (Form1.cs, Form1.designer.cs) to make more forms to expand on the app you desire to create!
# Con's
There is no Drag n' Drop GUI (like Visual Studio) to add your items, or set your values in properties. (This means you will have to set "properties" values, strings, etc. manually)
You can't preview your recent changes as a GUI. (This means you have to run your app every time you make changes in order to see the made changes)
You have to add the source code of any other template you desire to use. (Such as libraries)
