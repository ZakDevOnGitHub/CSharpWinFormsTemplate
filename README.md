# CSharpWinFormsTemplate

Hello guys! this repository contains a C# WinForms template that can be used to create desktop applications Platformwide!

# WinForms
WinForms is short for Windows Forms, WinForms is an open source Graphical User Interface (aka GUI) class library that is powered by ".NET".
It is used to create desktop apps and also heavily used by an IDE called Visual Studio. WinForms is a great way to create your desktop applications in C#!
# Pro's and Con's
# Pro's
This C# WinForm template can be used in any C#-supported code editor as long as it uses ".NET Core" to compile the code.
It is very easy to add items (such as Buttons, Labels, Textboxes, etc.) to your WinForm apps.
You can copy files like (Form1.cs, Form1.designer.cs) to make more forms to expand on the app you desire to create!
# Con's
There is no Drag n' Drop GUI (like Visual Studio) to add your items, or set your values in properties. (This means you will have to set "properties" values, strings, etc. manually)
You can't preview your recent changes as a GUI. (This means you have to run your app every time you make changes in order to see the made changes)
You have to add the source code of any other template you desire to use. (Such as libraries)
# How to use this template
we've gone over the Pro's and Con's of this WinForms template, now we're going to show you how you can use it to create your apps!
### Windows
## Step 1: Install .NET Software Development Kit (aka SDK)
NOTE: This repository is not needed for Windows as you can create a WinForms template by running "dotnet new winforms" in your dedicated folder. (as long as you finished all of the steps)

Once you've downloaded it, go to your downloads folder (or where the file downloaded to) and double click the dotnet-sdk-7.X.XXX-win-(x64/x32).exe
Follow the instructions and make sure you have enough disk space to install it.
## Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code and use it
Download Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
When you finish installing .NET SDK, open Visual Studio Code. Once it opens, choose your dedicated folder you want to use to create the WinForms template.
Then click "View" on the menu strip and click Terminal.
In Terminal, type "dotnet new winforms"; A new WinForms template will appear.
You can now start coding in your WinForms environment!
